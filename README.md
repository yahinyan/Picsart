Overview

The repository includes C++ implementations of the Matrix and Pixel classes. The Matrix class is designed to represent a 2D matrix of Pixel objects, each storing RGB color values. The provided functionality allows for manipulation and printing of matrices.

File Structure

matrix.h: Header file for the Matrix class.
matrix.cpp: Implementation file for the Matrix class.
pixel.h: Header file for the Pixel class.
pixel.cpp: Implementation file for the Pixel class.
main1.cpp, main2.cpp, main3.cpp: Example usage of the Matrix and Pixel classes.
Usage

To use the Matrix and Pixel classes, include the respective header files in your project:

Copy code
#include "matrix.h"
#include "pixel.h"
Instantiate a Matrix object with a specified width and height:

Copy code
Matrix myMatrix(3, 3);
You can then manipulate and print the matrix using the provided member functions.

Pixel Class

The Pixel class represents a color pixel with RGB values. It includes functionality for checking and setting RGB values.

Examples

Check the provided example files (main1.cpp, main2.cpp, main3.cpp) for detailed usage examples of the Matrix and Pixel classes.
